<p>CSS PRE is your one-stop reference for the three most popular CSS Preprocessors - Less, Sass, and Stylus. The project is in its infancy, <a href="https://github.com/futekov/csspre">contribute on GitHub</a> to make it better!</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The code examples for Sass on this site use the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html">indented syntax</a>, in the future SCSS syntax snippets may be added as well.</p>

<p>Stylus allows extreme freedom in terms of syntax, one can omit braces, semicolons, and even colons. To be future-proof, this site will only show Stylus snippets with colons (no semicolons or braces) and with a <code>$</code> sign before each variable (which is currently <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/variables.html">optional</a>) because this is <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/wiki/1.0.0#what-to-change-in-syntax">how Stylus will most likely work in the future</a>. I advise you to read Stylus' resources on <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/selectors.html">what is allowed in terms of syntax</a>.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<p>This site is closely tied to CodePen, as a result all code is written to be compatible with the versions of the preprocessors that CodePen supports - <a href="http://codepen.io/versions/#less-version">Less</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io/versions/#sass-version">Sass</a>, and <a href="http://codepen.io/versions/#stylus-version">Stylus</a>.</p>

<h2>Thanks to</h2>

<p>All code snippets can be launched in a new tab and played around with, you should thank <a href="http://codepen.io/about/">the great people at CodePen</a> for that.</p>
